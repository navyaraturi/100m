I am going to build 100m a tasks application. Let's first start with writing what users will be doing here, features:

1. user signs up
2. user logins in
3. user can create tasks

technology stack:
runtime: bun + js
backend framework: express
documentation: [TODO]
frontend: html + js + bootstrap / any static UI library
database: mongodb
